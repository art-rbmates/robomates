# Robomates

Welcome to the **Robomates** repository! This repository contains a 3D model of the **Robomate V1**, a small gaming robot designed for interactive and strategic gameplay. 

We understand that it will not be easy to launch **Robomate V1** without PCBs, a complete code base and all other mechanical components. We are working on turning the robot into a kit that you can assemble yourself. Stay tuned!
